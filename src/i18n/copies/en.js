      question: "where did the project idea come from?",
      answer: "Our business idea was born during the summer holidays. While walking around the city, we came across people with disabilities. We wondered how people with disabilities cope in everyday life. \n \n They appeared to be very resilient and strong, but we also noticed that they faced numerous obstacles. This case inspired us to think about creating an app that could make their everyday life easier by helping them find a job and access the right medical services. \n \n Our goal is to create a tool that will be part of the solution to these problems and contribute to a more accessible and inclusive world for people with disabilities.",

Wide functionality: From medication reminders to navigation and SOS calls, our app combines many useful tools in one place. \n \n  3. Inclusivity: Built with different user needs in mind, ensuring accessibility and convenience for all users, regardless of their abilities. \n \n 4. Community and support: Allows you to connect with other users, share experiences and support each other in a community. \n \n 5. Effective care coordination: The SOS button and tracking of blind people allow you to quickly respond to emergencies and provide assistance when needed. \n \n These advantages allow our app to be a useful and necessary tool to support people with disabilities in everyday life.",
